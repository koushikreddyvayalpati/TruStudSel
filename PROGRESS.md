## How to Proceed

1. Start by expanding test coverage using the new API mocking system
2. Implement remaining tests for all components
3. Ensure all API interactions are properly tested

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress in restructuring the TruStudSel application to follow industry best practices. The new architecture will make the app more maintainable, scalable, and easier to develop as a team. The separation of concerns and proper typing will reduce bugs and improve developer experience.

With the addition of comprehensive API mocking for tests, we now have a robust foundation for testing all aspects of the application, ensuring reliability and stability as we continue to develop new features.
